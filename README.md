### Step 1: Data Cleaning with Python
- Uploaded raw CSV file (`hotel_bookings.csv`) in Jupyter Notebook
- Performed data cleaning:
  - Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
  - Handled missing values (imputation and removal)
  - Converted data types
  - Detected and addressed outliers
- Saved the cleaned data as a new CSV: `cleaned_hotel_bookings.csv`

### Step 2: Visualization with Power BI
- Imported `cleaned_hotel_bookings.csv` into Power BI
- Created various visualizations:
  - Monthly booking and cancellation trends
  - Hotel type vs cancellation rate
  - Market segment and deposit type impact
  - Lead time analysis
  - Country-wise booking distribution
- Built an interactive dashboard using slicers, filters, and cards
